A huge thank you goes out to all our sponsors for making the coupon plugin a much
better product.
If it wasn't for our sponsors, the coupon plugin would still have much less
functionality than it does.

1. eLearn Solutions with Boston Connect (a subsidiary of Boston City Campus)

2. Ryanjbudhu (on github) for PR-21 (adding format_text() for course fullnames))

3. LTNC for the (paid) feature request for some defaulted/global settings (v4.3.3)
